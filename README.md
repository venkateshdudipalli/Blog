# Classification and Regression

## Classification:
  Classification is thought of finding a funnction  y = f(x)
  
      Imagine each review represented a vector X. Now given an X, I want to find a function F that will writtern for Y. Y is whether tha review is +ve or -ve, X is review text
      
      Mathamatically speaking my clasification is all about finding this magic function F such that given a review text, If I applying mathamatical function F on text review, I would get 'Y' which says wether the review is positive or not
